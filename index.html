<h1> Hi Guys! </h1> 
<h3><p> My name is <u>Dennie Devito</u> and you can call me Dennie.</p>
<font color = "blue" ><p>I am currently majoring in computer science for system and really looking forward 
to enter the pro school next quarter since this class is my last class for prerequisite for
pro-school computer science.</p></font>
<p>So on a scale from 0 to 10 about how much I know about HTML, probably my answer would be around 5.
It's is because I have already learnt HTML round 4 years ago when I was on my high school back in 
my country. But since it was a long time ago, I'm afraid I have already forget a lot of things since
I don't use it all this time. </p>
<font color = "blue" ><p>I hope that I can make my own website that can help my dad with his job. Well of course it's not
just a simple web. I hope in the end of this class, I can make a good and useful webs that can 
attract a lot of people to my web. </p></font>
<p>Yes I have already signed up for Piazza, and I have already seen a lot of question there actually.</p> 
<font color = "blue" ><p>Actually for the most interesting fact about me, I always go with my name! Do you realize that my name
is actually pretty similar, well I can say it is actually the same with an actor Danny DeVito?
It you have not hear about him before, he is one of famous actors and he is also a commedian. 
He also plays in the batman movie as batman's villain, penguin. 
My name is actually the same with him because my name IS from him. My parents are fans of him 
and they decided to give me his name as my name because they want me to be like him which is funny 
because he is a commedian, successful, and famous. My parents also want me to be fat like him because
in our culture, fat means that someone is prosperous! </p></font>
<p>This is a picture of me, which unfortunately a skiny guy : </p></h3>
