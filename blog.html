<h1> Hi Again Guys! This is my first post on 26th September 2016. </h1> 

<p> For this assignment on week 0, I dont think I faced too much troubles. it's just I haven't
touch HTML for a really long time that makes me forget some tags that I want to use. So I just google it 
and find all the tags that I want and I have to use to complete this assignment. </p>
<p> What did I already know probably is HTML. Although my knowledge about html is really limited this time,
but I think it's fair enough to do wekk 0's assignment. And what I learnt from compliting this assignment 
is about github. I seriously never touch github before and I really confused about how using github. 
Since this whole course will use github, I hope that I can understand github more and use it even more
in the future. </p>
<p> Like I said before, I didnt know about github at all before, so I will say that the most useful
resource in this assignment is the git hub web itself and the notes from the professor that explain 
about github. After that is the Piazza, since there are a lot of students who faces similar problems with me
and they posted their question in the piazza. Then there are also a lot of answer to their question which 
thankfully also answer my question. </p>
